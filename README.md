# Goal
Create a static landing page with limited budget. 

What customer wanted to be done - "I don't know, my friend just said that website is needed for any kind of business nowadays, I heard that landing pages aren't that expensive, can you create one for me? It would be cool if it can save all contact request to google sheets." © Customer

How customer wanted website look - "I like green color" © Customer

# Dev

Since all the customer explained is that app should save data about people who send request for call backs in google sheets. I've chosen to use google scripts for sending a notification via email to owner about new call back requests and save data to google sheets.

Technologies & libraries used in project:
- Jquery
- AOS
- Google Scripts
